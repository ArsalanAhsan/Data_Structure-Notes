Time complexity of an algorithm quantifies the amount of time taken by an algorithm to run as a function of the length of the input. 
**Types of notations**
1. O-notation: It is used to denote asymptotic upper bound. For a given function g(n), we denote it by O(g(n)). Pronounced as ‚Äúbig-oh of g of n‚Äù. It is also known as worst case time complexity as it denotes the upper bound in which the algorithm terminates. 
2. ‚Ñ¶-notation: It is used to denote asymptotic lower bound. For a given function g(n), we denote it by ‚Ñ¶(g(n)). Pronounced as ‚Äúbig-omega of g of n‚Äù. It is also known as best case time complexity as it denotes the lower bound in which the algorithm terminates. 
3. ùöØ-notation: It is used to denote the average time of a program.
