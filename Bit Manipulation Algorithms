Bit manipulation is the act of algorithmically manipulating bits or other pieces of data shorter than a word. Computer programming tasks that require bit manipulation include low-level device control, error detection and correction algorithms, data compression, encryption algorithms, and optimization12.

Here are some examples of bitwise algorithms:

To check if a number is even or odd.
To check if a number is a power of 2.
To swap two numbers without using a temporary variable.
To find the maximum or minimum of two numbers without using conditional statements.
To reverse the bits of an integer.
To count the number of set bits in an integer.
To multiply or divide by 2^n using bit shifting
