Bit manipulation is the act of algorithmically manipulating bits or other pieces of data shorter than a word. Computer programming tasks that require bit manipulation include low-level device control, error detection and correction algorithms, data compression, encryption algorithms, and optimization12.

Here are some examples of bitwise algorithms:

+ To check if a number is even or odd.
+ To check if a number is a power of 2.
+ To swap two numbers without using a temporary variable.
+ To find the maximum or minimum of two numbers without using conditional statements.
+ To reverse the bits of an integer.
+ To count the number of set bits in an integer
+ To multiply or divide by 2^n using bit shifting

## How Decimal Number works:

In computers, decimal numbers are represented using the binary number system. The binary number system uses only two digits, 0 and 1. Each digit in a binary number is called a bit. A group of 8 bits is called a byte.

For example, the decimal number 10 is represented as 1010 in binary
